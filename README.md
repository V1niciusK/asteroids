# Build an Asteroids Game

I have built a simple video game, based on the classic (Asteroids)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)]. If you've never played before, you can take a look at this (slightly different from our) (version of the game)[https://freeasteroids.org/].

### The finished project:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+ installed
- Access to a unix-like shell (e.g. zsh or bash)

### Learning Goals

The learning goals of this project are:

- Introduce myself to multi-file Python projects
- Learn you a real-world use case for object-oriented programming
- To have a ton of fun building a rewarding project!

Notice that the goal is not to learn game development or the math required for physics simulations. As a result, there are some places where I had simply copy-paste code that Boot.dev wrote for me.
